PURPOSE: 
the goal of this game is to cover as much of clovetopia as possible with your color. you do this by correctly answering challenge questions and successfully completing territory-conquering attacks. the better your weapon stats, the higher the chance of a successful attack, so upgrading and swapping to obtain better weapons will help you conquer more territory. (you can view weapon stats in the main menu)
